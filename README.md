# BioMaker Resources

Until there is a solid Instructables or Thingiverse channel we need a place to find cool BioMaker ideas.

## Participation

I'm literally the worst person in the world to organize this. Someone take this over. I'm just an agitator.

## Overview

I know, I know. You can make something out of wood and be doing "bio-maker". But I'm interested in finding the intersection of AI, synthetic biology, DIY manufacturing, renewable materials, art and weirdness. Can we 3d our own bio-robots?

There are a number of materials of interest.

* [Mycelium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycelium-based_materials) is the corpus of fungus. Mushrooms are fungal fruits. Mycelium has been turned into a number of different products, including my own hideious pencil cup I made in an [Open Fung](https://openfung.org/) workshop.
* [Scoby Leather](https://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/2021/11/04/biomaterials-what-scoby-leather) is made from kambucha.
  * [Cool example](https://www.pratt.edu/work/scoby-project-2/)
* [Bioplastic](https://naturelab.risd.edu/discover/biomaterials-you-can-make-at-home/) seems pretty awesome!

## Interesting People, Communities & Companies

* [Open Fung](https://openfung.org/) is dedicated to mycelium manufacturing.
  * [Open Fung Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/open.fung/) for you social people.
* [Genspace](https://www.genspace.org/) in New York. We really need this in Los Angeles.
* [SynBioBeta](https://www.synbiobeta.com/) is the largest synthetic biology org I know of. John Cumbers is the man.
* [MakerSpace](https://makerspace.com/) is aimed at education.
* [Eldy Lazaro](https://www.eldylazaro.com/?portfolio=diy-electronics-with-mycelium) has done some fascinating projects!
* [Jake Wintermute](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-wintermute/) has probably the best name in high tech (if you know, you know) and is a brilliant voice in the synbio space.
* [Marblis](https://marblis.com/stone) I literally screamed when I saw their pitch.  I spent a chunk of grad school pulling urchins out of kelp forests.  Good times...
* [MycoWorks](https://www.mycoworks.com/) are probably the reigning champions of biomanufacturing coolness.
* [The Thought Emporium](https://www.thethoughtemporium.com/) are both fascinating and nauseating at the same time.
* [Framework Computers](https://frame.work/) build your own f(n) laptop, baby. Sick of vendor lock-in and we should be able to fix what we have.
* [Eclipse Theia](https://theia-ide.org/) Everything I make will need software. I'm not going to go into detail on open source stacks, but with Cursor AI being stupidly overvalued, we need an open source alternative.
* [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) the future is collaborative, volumetric immersive.  We'll need this.

## Project Ideas

Things on my mind I'd probably pay someone to build. Somone who won't cut off their own thumb trying to start a printer.

### Eurorack Frame

[Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack) is my current hobby. Man, it's expensive. But it would be cool to wrap these cases in something like mycelium or scoby. Having fruiting mushrooms on stage opens a world of biopunk coolness. Do we still use "biopunk" or....?

### Autonomous Dolly

Let's take a scooter engine, dress it up like a Jawa sandcrawler, give it self-guiding lidar and wrap it in scoby.  C'mon! What are we waiting for? I'll use it to load my amplifiers on stage.
